Zoo Website
Overview
The Zoo Website is a family-friendly web application designed to showcase a virtual zoo experience, featuring various animal categories, interactive elements, and an adoption/purchase system for animal merchandise or sponsorship. Built using HTML and CSS, the website provides an engaging and visually appealing interface for users to explore animals, enjoy virtual shows, and support the zoo through adoptions. Developed by Saira Batool, a student at UET Lahore (Narowal Campus), this project demonstrates proficiency in front-end web development with a focus on user experience and accessibility.
